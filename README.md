# Verity

  Verity's name is derived from the Latin _verus_, meaning _true_ in English.

## Our Goal:
Verity aims to create a **fully customisable** operating system that gives people *what they want* and change the tech world for the **better**. If you have an idea or feature you want, make a pull request or email me at **elliott.kelly08@outlook.com**. I’ll implement it as soon as the OS is ready for it!
## How we will stand out
Linux is great. If you know your stuff. But what about the non techies? The people without a computer science degree. We aim to give them a say in software. With Verity it doesn't matter! Anyone can request new features, whether you know 5 languages or none at all! VerOS is about being true to the people. Giving them what they want. Contributing to this OS isn't just done by the _techies_, it's done by _everyone_
## Contributions
We want **everyone**, whether techie or non-techie, to be a part of this project.
